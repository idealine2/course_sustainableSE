summary: "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
artificial intelligence by delivering unprecedented performance in
various applications. However, their substantial computational
demands have raised critical concerns regarding high energy
consumption and environmental impact, especially during infer-
ence on local machines. This paper introduces Green Llama,
an innovative command-line tool designed to monitor and ana-
lyze the energy usage of LLMs across CPU, GPU, and RAM
components. By providing prompt-based estimation of power
consumption and translating these metrics into carbon emissions
based on regional energy profiles, Green Llama bridges the gap
between performance benchmarking and sustainability assess-
ment. With integrated features such as mid-session summaries,
detailed reporting, and comprehensive benchmark testing, the
tool empowers developers, researchers, and organizations to
monitor energy consumption, reduce operational costs, and make
environmentally responsible deployment decisions."
