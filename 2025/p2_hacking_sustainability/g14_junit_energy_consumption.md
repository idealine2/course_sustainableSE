title: "Measuring Energy Consumption of JUnit Tests"
group_number: 14
summary: "Unit testing is a fundamental part of software development. We measured energy usage of various JUnit test suites belonging to open-source Java projects. Using our own experiment pipeline we insert JoularJX into the project definitions to enable measurement of individual unittests. With the results we were able to define a few test definitions that are an indication of high energy usage."
