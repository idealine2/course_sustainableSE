summary: "Sustainable Sprint is an educational board game inspired by 'The Game of Goose' designed to teach sustainable software development principles in an engaging way. Recognizing that the environmental impact of software is often overlooked, the game aims to make developers aware of how inefficient coding contributes to energy waste. Players navigate a board with tiles that present knowledge-based questions, challenges related to green coding, and elements of chance. By answering questions correctly and making sustainable choices, players advance towards the final square. The game features two levels of questions to cater to both beginner and experienced programmers, covering topics from basic energy-saving coding practices to more complex concepts like optimizing cloud computing. The goal is to be the first player to reach the end, all while learning how to create energy-efficient and eco-friendly software."
